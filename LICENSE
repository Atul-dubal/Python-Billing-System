=======================================================================

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
fullest extent possible.

Preamble

The purpose of this license is to make a work (the "licensed work")
freely and legally available to the public for sharing, remixing, and
other uses consistent with the principles of non-commercial education
and research and to protect the attribution rights generally
recognized in the copyright law of the United States. Creative Commons
believes that its open access, open source approach to copyright
licensing provides a defense to the legal threats that are increasingly
being used to silence and intimidate legitimate acts of online
sharing, collaboration, and innovation at a time when these activities
are under constant threat from ever more restrictive copyright
laws.

This license, the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-
NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, grants permission to
exercise certain rights under copyright, so long as certain
conditions are met. For the purposes of this license, the rights
granted and restricted fall into three categories:

    * the right to make copies, distribute, display, and perform
      the licensed work;
    * the right to prepare derivative works of the licensed
      work; and
    * the right to make commercial use of the licensed work.

The rights granted under this license are subject to two important
limitations. First, any use or reproduction of the licensed work
outside the scope of this license is subject to the copyright law
of the United States and the copyright law of the relevant
jurisdiction. This means that if you engage in a use of the
licensed work that is not authorized by this license, you will
incur legal liability and potentially be subject to civil and
criminal penalties. Second, any attempt to circumvent the
protections built into the Creative Commons licenses is a breach
of this license and may result in the immediate termination of
the rights granted under this license.

The License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
       and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
       derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
       literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
       cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
       be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
       derived from the original.

    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
       as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
       broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
       in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
       arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
       which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
       with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
       independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
       a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
       considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
       License.

    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
       at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved
       by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
       including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms
       that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
       Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
       of adaptations of works made available under that license under this
       License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
       License Elements as this License.

    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
       copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
       other transfer of ownership.

    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
       as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
       Attribution, NonCommercial, and NoDerivatives.

    f. "Licensor" means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this License.

    g. "NonCommercial" means not primarily intended for or directed towards
       commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this
       Public License, the exchange of the Work for other material
       subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or
       similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of
       monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.

    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
       terms of this License including without limitation any production
       in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
       the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
       a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
       other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
       work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
       composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
       sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
